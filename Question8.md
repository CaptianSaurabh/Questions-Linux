You suspect that a particular process is consuming excessive CPU resources on your Linux server. How would you identify and terminate this process


To identify and terminate a process consuming excessive CPU resources on a Linux server, I'd follow these steps:

>>Step 1: Identify the process using top or htop command

Open a terminal and run the top or htop command to display a list of running processes and their resource usage. The top command is a traditional Unix utility, while htop is a more interactive and user-friendly alternative.
:Code
top
or
:Code
htop
In the output, look for the process with the highest CPU usage percentage. You can sort the processes by CPU usage by pressing P (for top) or clicking on the CPU% column header (for htop).

>>Step 2: Identify the process ID (PID)

Note down the Process ID (PID) of the process consuming excessive CPU resources. You can find the PID in the PID column of the top or htop output.

>>Step 3: Verify the process details using ps command

Use the ps command to gather more information about the process, such as its command line arguments, memory usage, and parent process.
:Code
ps -p <PID> -o pid,ppid,cmd,%cpu,%mem
Replace <PID> with the actual process ID you noted down in Step 2.

>>Step 4: Terminate the process using kill command

Once you've verified that the process is indeed consuming excessive CPU resources, you can terminate it using the kill command.
:Code
kill <PID>
Replace <PID> with the actual process ID.

If the process doesn't respond to the kill command, you can use the kill -9 command to forcefully terminate it.
:Code
kill -9 <PID>
Alternative: Use pkill command

If you know the name of the process or its command line arguments, you can use the pkill command to terminate it.
:Code
pkill -f <process_name>
Replace <process_name> with the actual name of the process or its command line arguments.
