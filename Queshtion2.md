What is the diffrent beatbeen hardlink and shoftlik?

In Linux, a hard link and a soft link (also known as a symbolic link) are two types of file links that serve different purposes.

>> Hard Link:

A hard link is a direct link to a file on a file system. It is a reference to the inode (a data structure that stores file metadata) of the original file. Hard links are created using the ln command without the -s option.

some key characteristics of hard links:

A hard link is a direct reference to the original file's inode.
Hard links share the same inode as the original file.
Changes made to the hard link affect the original file, and vice versa.
Hard links can only be created on the same file system as the original file.
If the original file is deleted, the hard link remains, but it becomes a dangling link (a link that points to a non-existent file).


>> Soft Link (Symbolic Link):

A soft link, also known as a symbolic link, is a reference to the path of the original file. It is a special type of file that contains the path to the original file. Soft links are created using the ln command with the -s option.

some key characteristics of soft links:

A soft link is a reference to the path of the original file.
Soft links have their own inode, separate from the original file's inode.
Changes made to the soft link do not affect the original file, and vice versa.
Soft links can be created across different file systems.
If the original file is deleted, the soft link becomes a broken link (a link that points to a non-existent file)
